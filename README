PHLAWD
======

There are several verisons of phlawd floating around:

*   The official version of phlawd at https://github.com/blackrim/phlawd
    entered maintenance mode Sep 2012 and has not had its code updated
    since then.

*   The "chinchliff" fork of phlawd was last updated in Mar 2016 and
    contains a number of bug fixes and features, including the ability
    to use whole genome sequences and "shrinking" to the target gene.

This is an unofficial fork, which updates the code for the GenBank ID change
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/news/03-02-2016-phase-out-of-GI-numbers/)
and downloads GenBank daily updates in addition to the regular releases.
